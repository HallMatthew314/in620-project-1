# Project 1 - "Timing Game"

## Description

The device has a row of seven LEDs.
The LEDs will turn on and off in succession, the light moving and down the row.
The player can press a button to make the light pattern stop.
If the button is pressed, the light stops moving, stays on for a few seconds, and then starts moving again.
The player's goal is to stop the light while it is on the middle LED.

## Extensions

 - Use system interrupts to handle the button press
 - Use other buttons or potentiometer to change difficulty (LED speed)
